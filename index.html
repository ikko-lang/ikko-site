          <h2 class="redtext">What is Ikko?</h2>
          <p>Ikko is a language in development that</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is statically typed with type inference</li>
            <li>Is garbage collected</li>
            <li>Has no null value</li>
            <li>Has generics</li>
            <li>Offers pattern matching</li>
            <li>Has sum types</li>
            <li>Has a light syntax</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="redtext">Status</h2>
          <p>
            Ikko is just starting development. If you look at the roadmap below,
            you can see that most features haven't been built yet. The example
            shown here does run, however.

          <h3>Getting Ikko</h3>
          <p>
            Ikko is currently hosted on Github under its old name (Athena)
            here: <a href="https://github.com/jmikkola/athena">github.com/jmikkola/athena</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build Ikko, you will
            need <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Haskell
            Stack</a> installed. From there, you can run <code>make</code>
            inside the repository.
          </p>
          <p>
            To run an example, run a command like <code>stack exec athena --
            examples/fib.at</code>.
          </p>

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            Some new languages bring exciting new ideas to the table. This is
            not one of those. The goal of Ikko is to maximize the ROI on
            novelty, and to be the best language possible using only techniques
            and features that are reasonably well established.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ikko comes from my frustration with other programming languages. I
            found that I was often thinking, "this language would be so much
            better if it just had X from language Y." There was no single
            langauge that, to me, felt like it had quite the right mix.
          </p>

          <p>
            I like Haskell's type system, but the language is clunky to work in
            day-to-day. Rust has a similarly good type system, but I want a
            garbage collector (I don't do systems programming) and better
            support for immutability. I like the light syntax and fluid tooling
            of Go, but it forces you to write endless boilerplate to do anything
            modestly clever.

          <h2 class="redtext">Roadmap</h2>

          <h4>Milestone 0: Basic type inference</h4>
          <p>status: Done!</p>

          <h4>Milestone 1: Define useful functions</h4>
          <p>
            This includes basics, like input and output,
            access to characters within strings, basic data structures,
            and commonly used functions.
          </p>

          <h4>Milestone 2: Powerful expressions</h4>
          <p>
            Add support for closures, match and conditional expressions,
            and short function syntax.
          </p>

          <h4>Milestone 3: Packages</h4>
          <p>
            Add support for breaking code into multiple packages
            and multiple files.
          </p>

          <h4>Milestone 4: Add type classes</h4>
          <p>
            These are haskell-like type classes.
          </p>

          <h4>Milestone 5: Basic usability</h4>
          <p>
            Create a small standard library and add support for importing
            3rd party libraries.
          </p>

          <h4>Milestone 6: Compiler back end</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to the interpreter, add a compiler backend that
            produces efficient binaries.
          </p>

          <h4>Milestone 7: Language spec</h4>
          <p>
            Define the language in as much detail as possible so that
            there can be multiple correct implementations.
          </p>

          <h4>Future work</h4>
          <p>
            Future features may include a REPL, support for checked imutability,
            an effect system, compiler-derived code, compile-time programming,
            and reflection.
